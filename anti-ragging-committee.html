          <li><strong>Introduction:</strong>Ragging in India is a damaging form of interaction of the seniors in college or school with the juniors, new entrants or first year students.

Under the pretext of fun, a fresher student is often assaulted and intimidated by his seniors. This ritualised torture leaves an indelible impression on his mind. After experiencing the evil of ragging, a student develops a feeling of revenge for his ‘unjustified harassment’ and derives pleasure in ragging his juniors on his turn. So the trend goes on and students continue to suffer.Gouri Devi Institute of Medical Sciences & Hospital, hereinafter referred to as <strong>GIMSH</strong>, recognizes ragging as a social evil and pledges to take all necessary steps to curb ragging.</li>

                  <li>GIMSH shall utilize the vacation period before the start of the new academic year to launch wide publicity campaign against ragging through posters, leaflets. seminars, street plays, etc.</li>
                  <li>The faculties/ departments/ units of GIMSH shall have induction arrangements (including those which anticipate, identify and plan to meet any special needs of any specific section of students) in place well in advance of the beginning of the academic year with a clear sense of the main aims and objectives of the induction process.

A provision shall be made in the service rules for issuing certificates of appreciation to such members of the staff who report ragging which will form port of their service record.</li>

GIMSH shall engage or seek the assistance of professional counselors at the time of admissions to counsel `freshers’ in order to prepare them for the life ahead, particularly for adjusting to the life in hostels.</li>
                  <li> GIMSH through the leaflet mentioned above shall explain to the new entrants the arrangements for their induction and orientation which promote efficient and effective means of integrating them fully as students. The leaflet shall also inform the freshers about their rights as bonafide students of the institution and clearly instructing them that they should desist from doing anything against their will even if ordered by the seniors, and that they have nothing to fear as the institution cares for them and shall not tolerate any atrocities against them.</li>
                  <li>The leaflet mentioned above shall contain a calendar of events and activities laid down by the institution to facilitate and complement familiarization of freshers with the academic environment of the institution.</li>
                  <li>GIMSH shall also organize joint sensitization programmes of ‘freshers’ and seniors in accordance with the MCI notification.</li>
                  <li>Freshers shall be encouraged to report incidents of ragging, either as victims, or even as witnesses.</li>

                  <li>At the end of every academic year GIMSH shall form a ‘Mentoring Cell’ consisting of Mentors for the succeeding academic year in accordance with MCI notification.</li>
                </ul>
              </li>
              <li><strong>Setting up of Committees and their functions</strong>
